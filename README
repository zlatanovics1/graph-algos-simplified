# Graphs simplified

## Explanation of the Code

This C program defines a graph and implements several algorithms to manipulate and analyze the graph, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, Floyd-Warshall algorithm, and Topological Sorting.

## Algorithms Used

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
4. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**
5. **Topological Sorting**

## NOTE

**All algorithms use adjacency list. Adjust that to your needs.**
